        A scan of the atomic transition is performed by reaccelerating (retarding) the incoming ions just before they enter the Charge exchange cell. This is achieved by applying a variable voltage to a set of retardation lenses in the range of Â±10kV. The change in speed of the ions results in a frequency shift of the laser frequency in the rest frame of the atoms due to the Doppler effect.
        The detection system is located at the end of the beam line. It consists of 8 large-diameter aspheric lenses which transfer light generated by fluorescent de-excitation to 4 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs).
        In addition to optical detection, a range of other non-optical detection techniques are used to study radioactive isotopes with extremely low production rates.
