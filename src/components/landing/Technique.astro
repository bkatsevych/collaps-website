          All methods used in the COLLAPS experiment are based on the technique of the collinear laser spectroscopy. This method was developed in mid-1970s by S.L. Kaufman: see <a class="text-amber-500" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0030-4018(76)90267-4" target="_blank"> S.L. Kaufman, Opt. Comm. 17, 309-312 (1976)</a>.
          COLLAPS is an experiment located at the “radioactive isotope factory” ISOLDE at CERN. The radioactive ions produced by ISODLE are delivered to the COLLAPS beamline. To access appropriate atomic transition for the wide range of short-lived nuclei produced by ISOLDE, the COLLAPS laser systems routinely produce extremely narrow linewidth laser light in the full ~210 nm to 1000 nm range.

          Although ISOLDE as a general rule provides an ionic beam in the 1+ charge state, it is frequently better to perform laser spectroscopy on the neutral atom. In order to neutralise the ions from ISODLE, the ionic beam is passing through a charge exchange cell (CEC) filled with alkaline vapours where by collisional charge transfer the ions become atoms. In other cases, we perform spectroscopy directly on the ion. Recent examples include beryllium, magnesium, calcium and scandium.
