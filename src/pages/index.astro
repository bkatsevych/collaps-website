const intro = `At COLLAPS we observe the tiny changes in atomic energy levels which are due to the specific properties of the nucleus. Consequently, our work brings together expertise in atomic and nuclear physics, as determination of nuclear properties from these tiny changes requires a good understanding of the atomic system. To observe these tiny changes in atomic energy levels we use extremely narrow linewidth lasers to probe the relevant atomic transitions. Typically, the linewidth of these lasers is in the range of 1/1 000 000 000 of the energy of the transition. To reach this level of stability for the full range of atomic elements studied requires our third area of expertise - laser systems.`

const text = `A scan of the atomic transition is performed by reaccelerating (retarding) the incoming ions just before they enter the Charge exchange cell. This is achieved by applying a variable voltage to a set of retardation lenses in the range of Â±10kV. The change in speed of the ions results in a frequency shift of the laser frequency in the rest frame of the atoms due to the Doppler effect.
        The detection system is located at the end of the beam line. It consists of 8 large-diameter aspheric lenses which transfer light generated by fluorescent de-excitation to 4 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs).
        In addition to optical detection, a range of other non-optical detection techniques are used to study radioactive isotopes with extremely low production rates.        `
